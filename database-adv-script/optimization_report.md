# Bookings Query Performance Analysis

## BEFORE (SELECT *)

Query selects all columns from bookings, users, properties, and payments.

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT b.*, u.*, p.*, pay.*
FROM bookings b
JOIN users AS u
    ON b.user_id = u.user_id
JOIN properties AS p
    ON b.property_id = p.property_id
JOIN payments AS pay
    ON b.booking_id = pay.booking_id;
```

**Result:**

```sql
                                                                 QUERY PLAN

 Execution Time: 148.458 ms

```

**Observations:**

- Bookings: 100,000 rows: full table scan, heavy  
- Payments: 100,000 rows: full scan adds more cost  
- Users: 1,000 rows: joining is cheap  
- Properties: primary key index used: quick lookup  
- `SELECT *` increases width (335): more data moved in memory  
- Hash Joins and Nested Loops move large amounts of data: expensive  
- Would scale poorly if tables grow larger  

**Query Plan Highlights:**

- Nested Loop over Hash Joins  
- Seq Scans on bookings and payments  
- Index Scan only on properties  
- Execution cost: `4891..13279` 
- Execution time: `148 ms`
- Width: `335`  

**Takeaway:** Works but inefficient. Could improve by selecting specific columns, applying filters, or reducing joins.

## AFTER (SELECT SPECIFIC COLUMNS)

Query selects only the necessary columns from bookings, users, properties, and payments.

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT 
    b.start_date,
    b.end_date,
    b.total_price,
    b.status,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    u.email,
    p.name AS property_name,
    p.city,
    p.country,
    pay.amount,
    pay.payment_method
FROM bookings b
JOIN users AS u
    ON b.user_id = u.user_id
JOIN properties AS p
    ON b.property_id = p.property_id
JOIN payments AS pay
    ON b.booking_id = pay.booking_id;
```

**Result:**

```sql
                                                                   QUERY PLAN

 Execution Time: 108.287 ms
(20 rows)
```

**Observations:**

- Width dropped to `100`: less data moved in memory  
- Execution time dropped to `108 ms`: query is slightly faster
- Execution cost decreased: `3424..9898`: query should run faster  
- Indexes still used where possible (properties)  
- All joins remain necessary to get full details  

**Query Plan Highlights:**

- Nested Loop over Hash Joins  
- Index Scan on properties  
- Seq Scans on bookings, users, payments  
- Execution cost reduced
- Execution time reduced
- Width reduced

## FILTERED QUERY (USING WHERE CONDITIONS)

Query selects specific columns and applies filters to reduce scanned rows.

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT 
    b.start_date,
    b.end_date,
    b.total_price,
    b.status,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    u.email,
    p.name AS property_name,
    p.city,
    p.country,
    pay.amount,
    pay.payment_method
FROM bookings b
JOIN users AS u
    ON b.user_id = u.user_id
JOIN properties AS p
    ON b.property_id = p.property_id
LEFT JOIN payments AS pay
    ON b.booking_id = pay.booking_id
WHERE b.total_price > 800 AND b.status = 'confirmed';
```

**Result:**

```sql

```

**Observations:**

- Filters on `total_price` and `status` reduce rows from 100,000 to 12,439  
- Bitmap Index Scan used on `status` (`idx_bookings_status`) speeds up filtering  
- Nested Loops and Hash Joins now process fewer rows: faster execution  
- Index Scan on `properties_pkey` still used for property lookup.
- Width remains `100` as we still select specific columns  
- LEFT JOIN on payments preserves all bookings even without a payment  

**Query Plan Highlights:**

- Bitmap Index Scan on bookings status  
- Nested Loop over Hash Joins with fewer rows  
- Index Scan on properties  
- Execution cost reduced: `2827..5572`
- Execution time: `35 ms`: the query is much faster
- Query is much faster due to filtering  

**Takeaway:** Adding meaningful filters drastically reduces scanned rows and execution cost, making the query scale much better.

## Conclusion

- **Step 1 – Select specific columns instead of `*`:**  
    - Width reduced from `335` to `100`, less data moved per row.  
    - Execution cost dropped from `4891..13279` to `3424..9898`. 
    - Execution time dropped from `148 ms` to `108 ms`. 
    - Index used: only `properties_pkey` on properties table.  

- **Step 2 – Add filtering with `WHERE` clause (`b.total_price > 800 AND b.status = 'confirmed'`):**  
    - Further reduced rows scanned.  
    - Execution cost dropped from `3424..9898` to `2827..5572`.  
    - Execution time dropped from `108 ms` to `35 ms`.
    - Width remains `100`.  
    - Indexes used:  
        - `properties_pkey` on properties (PK)  
        - `idx_bookings_status` on bookings (for status filter)
        - `idx_payments_booking_id` on payments.booking_id  

- **Takeaway:**  
    - Selecting only needed columns and applying meaningful filters drastically reduces memory usage, scanned rows, and overall execution cost.  
    - Joins on indexed columns are efficient, but indexes mainly speed up filtering rather than full table joins.  
    - PostgreSQL now scans fewer rows on bookings, properties, and payments, making the final query much faster and more scalable.
